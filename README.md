# AlphaDock. A PyMol Plugin for AutoDock Vina.

## Setup 

The application consists of two parts: 
  - The GUI to access AlphaDock through PyMol
  - The backend, where docking is performed. We recommend to run the docker container for the backend on a server/workstation, and have all users connect to it. This way not every user needs a docker installation


### GUI - PyMol 

Download the github repository and add it to your path under
```
Plugin -> Plugin Manager -> Settings -> Add new directory ... -> Point to the downloaded repository
